# iSkin
This is a team project (3 students) for CSCI6221 Advanced Software Paradigms.

## Abstract
iSkin is an application created for anyone who wants to know the ingredients in their skincare or cosmetic products. The skincare and cosmetics industry influences people to purchase and use products that may or may not be good for a customer's skin. Customerâ€™s then can suffer from the negative long term effects of the chemicals and ingredients in the products. Hence, it is crucial to know what chemicals and ingredients are in the skincare or cosmetic products that you use and to find the right ingredients for your skin. The iSkin application will allow cosmetic users to check the ingredients in products in realtime. Ingredients lists in products are generally written in a very small font and are not the easiest words to search for especially in the midst of shopping. With iSkin, the user can simply scan the ingredient list of a product. Then the application will read the ingredients and display the description of the ingredient and the ranking of the ingredient.
